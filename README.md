# Software-fault-prediction-using-reduced-set

So in our project, firstly we are taking the data set and reducing the dimensions of the data set so as to have more accurate prediction. 
So the feature reduction is the highlight of our project. We tried comparing different algorithms and methods to reduce and extract features, 
the co-relation matrix to reduce the dimension of the model, but found out that PCA works best for greater dimensional datasets like ours which could 
have up to 86 dimensions.

Already existing systems did not use any kind of dimension reduction algorithms, which we have used in our project. 
Also we are comparing the two models of SVM and Na√Øve bayse, to see which of them is more accurate and has better performance.
We have successfully increased the efficiency of the system and reduce 22 dimensions to 2 or 3.
